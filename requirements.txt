Requirements:

* Streamlit
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Joblib
* numpy

Why these five?
1. streamlit: To build the web interface.
2. pandas: To handle the data tables (DataFrames) inside the app.
3. scikit-learn: This is the most important one. It contains the logic for your Random Forest model and the Scaler. Without this, the app won't understand how to predict.
4. joblib: Used to load your .pkl files (the model and scaler).
5. numpy: Used for the mathematical calculations and ratios.
